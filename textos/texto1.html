				<p>The night was dark. &nbsp;The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon, and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the darkness.</p>
				<h2>It was not enough to reach the walls</h2>
				<p>It was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives. &nbsp;Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood, which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had been taken out, the rest would yield easily.</p>
				<p>They set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide. &nbsp;They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside. &nbsp;Passepartout and the guide stopped. &nbsp;Had they been heard? &nbsp;Was the alarm being given? </p>
				<h2>The guards now appeared at the rear of the temple</h2>
				<p>Common prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis. &nbsp;They again hid themselves in the wood, and waited till the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay. &nbsp;But, awkwardly enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise.</p>
				<p>It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus interrupted in their work. &nbsp;They could not now reach the victim; how, then, could they save her? &nbsp;Sir Francis shook his fists, Passepartout was beside himself, and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage. &nbsp;The tranquil Fogg waited, without betraying any emotion.</p>
				<h2>With the ten warriors</h2>
				<p>In this way, with ten warriors, I built a series of three steps from the ground to the shoulders of the topmost man. &nbsp;Then starting from a short distance behind them I ran swiftly up from one tier to the next, and with a final bound from the broad shoulders of the highest I clutched the top of the great wall and quietly drew myself to its broad expanse. &nbsp;</p>
				<p>After me I dragged six lengths of leather from an equal number of my warriors. &nbsp;These lengths we had previously fastened together, and passing one end to the topmost warrior I lowered the other end cautiously over the opposite side of the wall toward the avenue below. &nbsp;No one was in sight, so, lowering myself to the end of my leather strap, I dropped the remaining thirty feet to the pavement below.</p>
